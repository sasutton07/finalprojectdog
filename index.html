    <p>I plan on doing my final project on my dog biscuit. There could be a home page with just general info and photos, a page about his favorite activities, a page about how and when we adopted him, a page about the possible breeds we think he is since he is a mutt, maybe an image gallery. Just a few random ideas i'll choose from.</p>

        <li>Possible Breeds</li>
